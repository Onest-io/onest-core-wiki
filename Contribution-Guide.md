## [DRAFT] BitShares Contribution Guidance Using GitHub

This document, as a draft, intends to provide guidance and solicit feedback from Team Members and the Community. It does not intend to be a directive at this time. The goal is to explore, refine and finally define a collaboration framework using GitHub. Provided below are links to sample items for demonstration purposes. After reading the article, you are encouraged to apply the concepts introduced within the [Contribution Guide](https://github.com/bitshares/bitshares-core/projects/6) Project for further refinement. Please provide feedback by opening an Issue or commenting therein. Once the Core Team has refined their processes, this document will loose its [DRAFT] status and we apply them throughout the BitShares-Core repo.

## INTRODUCTION

Please note: The BitShares Core Team intends to adopt agile principals where appropriate, but not be strictly held to them. 

Collaboration within open source projects is key to advancing their development and adoption. GitHub serves as the central repository for code and collaboration today and the intention is to continue using this open platform.
